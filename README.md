# Random Password Generator

The goal of this project was to work off of pre-existing code to complete the build of a Random Password Generator.  When the URL is loaded, the user is presented with a button tied to a click event for generating a password.  Once the button is clicked the user is presented with a prompt and several confirms to determine the length of the password and what type of characters to use.  After the user inputs their answers a random password is presented to them on screen with the parameters they provided.
